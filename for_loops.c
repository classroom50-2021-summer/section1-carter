    A general "for loop" looks like this:

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        // some code
    }

    This particular loop repeats whatever code is inside its brackets,
    incrementing i each time, and stopping when i = 10.

    Let's play around with changing various parts of a for loop,
    within which we'll place a print statement for a hash.

    What shapes can you make when you:

    - Set i equal to another variable, and not a constant?
    - Decrement i by 1?
    - Increment i by more than 1?
    - Change the name of i?
    - Put a for loop inside of another for loop?

    printf("#"); // Prints a hash
    printf("\n"); // Moves cursor to new line
